Disclaimer
----------
It needs a HUGE work on design, I don't know how to design so please, don't
remember me it is ugly, i know.

Description
-----------
Drop n load is a chunked uploader with drag and drop capabilities.

You can upload any number of files no matter its weight –tested up to 3GB– and 
the uploader splits them into chunks and starts uploading.


Configuration
-------------
You can configure it from index.html.

{% syntax javascript %}
// Initialize Upload object
window.upload = new Upload({
    uploadScript: 'serverScript.php',
    uploadFolder: 'uploads/',
    tempFolder: 'tmp/',
    chunkSize: 200000,
    maxUploadSize: 2000000000,
    files: []
});

// Initialize Drag and Drop object
window.dragAndDrop = new DragAndDrop({
    droppableContainerId: 'droppable-container',
    borderStyleOnDragover: '6px dashed #444',
    uploadButtonId: 'upload-button',
    droppablePlaceholderId: 'droppable-placeholder'
});

function fire() {
    upload.uploadFile(0);
}
{% endsyntax %}
